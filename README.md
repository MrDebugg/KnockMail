# KnockMail
KnockMail is a Gmail Bruteforce Script written in Python.
Use it only against Accounts you have permission to do so.

Usage:
  
  python gmail.py EMAILADRESS PASSWORDLIST
  
 Replace EMAILADRESS with a valid Email Adress like (test@gmail.com)
 Replace PASSWORDLIST with a valid Password List like (rockyou.txt)
 
 Have fun using this Script if anything won't work let me know
 and i'll try to fix it.
